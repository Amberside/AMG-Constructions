                            AMG Constructions undertook a construction project on our behalf. The project was complex,
                            involved multiple trades, a tight program and took place within an occupied Melbourne CBD
                            building. The site was challenging in terms of access and the work site itself required
                            conduct sensitive to the needs of the occupants of the building.

                            We used Andy and his team for our recent renovation. It was a significantly large project,

                            every step of the way, not only in terms of the build but also offering his advice and
                            support to resolve any issues. Since completion, Andy has maintained contact and offered
                            assistance whenever required. Andy’s team have also been fantastic to deal with, they are
                            all lovely people and would accommodate any requests, and also are very hard working. We
                            feel Andy has gone above and beyond for us and are very thankful to have developed a close
